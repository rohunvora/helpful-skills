# Cool Claude Skills

<!-- [PLACEHOLDER: logo/image] -->

Skills that teach Claude Code how to do things you'd otherwise explain every time.

---

## quick-view

Turn terminal output into a webpage you can read.

Say "show me this" and Claude generates HTML, opens it in your browser. Useful for reviewing JSON, logs, lists, drafts — anything hard to scan in the terminal.

---

## table-filters

Add the right filter to each column.

Describe your data. Claude picks the filter type: text search, checkboxes, date range, numeric — based on what makes sense.

---

## html-style

Make HTML look finished.

Takes working markup, adds polish: dark mode, status colors, visual hierarchy. Pairs with quick-view and table-filters.

---

## incremental-fetch

Download API data without losing progress.

Saves after each page. Tracks position. Resumes if interrupted. Never re-downloads what you have.

---

## arena-cli

Export and search your Are.na visually.

Fetch blocks from channels. Enrich images with AI-generated titles and tags. Browse in a local gallery.

---

## Install

```sh
cp -r skills/quick-view ~/.claude/skills/
```

Claude picks it up automatically.
